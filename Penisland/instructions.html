<h3>Prep:</h3>
<p>All players choose a bottle cap as their game piece and begin at the “Start”. A cup is placed in the “Loser’s Brew” circle and each player pours a small chug of their beverage in it. As a group, decide what the penalty will be for losing a “mini” game (ex: some # of drinks). A good rule of thumb is to choose a number between 1-3 depending on how turnt you're trying to get. This will be enforced throughout the game as the “Loser Penalty”.</p>
<h3>Play:</h3>
<p>The game plays like any normal board game. Beginning with the Most Sexually Experienced Person in the group, each player takes turns rolling a single die (or 2 dice if more than 7 players) and advancing their bottle cap the rolled number of spaces. The arrival at the "Finish" is the ultimate objective, however the real goal of the game is to get weird.</p>
<p>The description of each space’s objective is found within this app. Certain spaces will prompt you to generate random themes/actions by clicking on a "Draw" button (similar to drawing a card). If a player loses a mini game or fails to adequately complete their task, they shall be subject to the "Loser Penalty". The game is over when only one player remains on the board. This poor soul must consume the "Loser’s Brew" or be banished from ever playing the game again. Don't feel too bad though -- this game is all about Karma.</p>
<h3>Rules:</h3>
<p>The only rule is to play it as it lies (i.e. fully commit to the game).</p>
<p><i>Note: if more than one person lands on the same space, the most recent person takes precedence.</i></p>
